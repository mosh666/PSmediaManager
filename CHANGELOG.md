# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to "Keep a Changelog" ([Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)) and uses Semantic Versioning ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)).

The format below is designed for clear GitHub Releases and PowerShell module maintenance.

## [Unreleased]

Use this section for in-progress changes that will be included in the next release.

When preparing a release, move the items into a new versioned section and update the date.

### Added

- CI/Security: Introduced `.github/workflows/codacy.yml` to run Codacy Analysis CLI on pushes, pull requests, and a weekly schedule so fresh findings flow into GitHub code scanning automatically.

### Changed

#### Current edits (2025-11-26)

- Test infrastructure: Enhanced test environment isolation by detecting `MEDIA_MANAGER_TEST_MODE` environment variable to prevent runtime folders (`PSmm.Log`, `PSmm.Plugins`, `PSmm.Vault`) from being created on system drive during test execution.
- Documentation: Added "Test Environment Isolation" section to `docs/development.md` explaining test mode behavior and path resolution strategy.
- Documentation: Expanded "Data & Storage Layout" section in `docs/architecture.md` to document production vs test mode path resolution differences.
- Configuration: Clarified that `DriveLetter` and `Path` are discovered at runtime and should not be persisted in `src/Config/PSmm/PSmm.App.psd1`. Removed now-ignored `StorageType` from examples.

#### Previous edits (2025-11-24)

- Documentation: added changelog link to `README.md`.
- Repository metadata: tidied `.github/CODEOWNERS` comment line.

- Chore (2025-11-24): Documentation & metadata tidy — added changelog link to `README.md` and cleaned `.github/CODEOWNERS` comment.

- Startup script: recalculated `Start-PSmediaManager.ps1`'s path to `src/PSmediaManager.ps1` with nested `Join-Path` calls to avoid analyzer complaints and edge-case path concatenation errors.
- Tooling: wrapped the `TypeNotFound` filter in `tests/Invoke-PSScriptAnalyzer.ps1` so the analyzer results stay in an array even when PowerShell returns a single object.

These are small documentation/metadata updates; move to a versioned release entry when shipping.

#### Docs, Coverage & CI (2025-11-25)

- Documentation: `README.md` now calls out that PSmediaManager is intended to live on a removable/external drive so hosts stay clean.
- Coverage: refreshed `tests/.coverage-latest.json` and `tests/.coverage-jacoco.xml` baselines (61.35% line coverage) generated by the tuned harness so CI enforces the latest numbers.
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` temporarily limits the matrix to `windows-latest` while analyzer preloading stabilizes, keeping GitHub Actions green until Linux runners are ready.

### Deprecated

- Once-proposed features scheduled for removal.

### Removed

- Tests: retired `tests/Modules/PSmm/Exit-Order.Tests.ps1` now that `Write-PSmmHost` export coverage is handled via module tests and integration smoke runs.
- CI: removed `.github/workflows/powershell-tests.yml` because the consolidated `ci.yml` plus the improved `tests/Invoke-Pester.ps1` cover the same validation steps.

### Fixed

#### 2025-11-26

- Fix (Test Infrastructure): Prevented Pester tests from creating `PSmm.Log`, `PSmm.Plugins`, and `PSmm.Vault` folders on the system drive (C:\) by implementing test mode detection in `AppConfigurationBuilder`. When `MEDIA_MANAGER_TEST_MODE='1'` is set (automatically by `Invoke-Pester.ps1`), runtime folders are created within the test directory instead of at the drive root, ensuring test isolation and preventing system pollution. Production behavior remains unchanged with runtime folders placed at drive root. (commit `97845fc`)
- Fix (Configuration Builder): Normalized storage configuration handling to derive `DriveLetter` and `Path` at runtime and ignore obsolete `StorageType` entries, preventing mismatches between persisted and live configuration. Updated `src/Modules/PSmm/Classes/AppConfigurationBuilder.ps1` accordingly.

#### 2025-11-24

- Fix: Constructed `SecureString` safely in `src/Modules/PSmm.Plugins/Private/Confirm-Plugins.ps1` to avoid using `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force`. (commit `c148f77`)
- Fix: Normalize analyzer runner outputs in `tests/Invoke-PSScriptAnalyzer.ps1` (`$results` and `$errors` coerced to arrays) to prevent `.Count` property errors when a single object is returned. (commit `c148f77`)
- Chore: Add `Write-PSmmHost` wrapper and replace scattered `Write-Host` calls across interactive scripts to centralize host output and improve static analysis compliance. (2025-11-24)
- Fix: Allow empty messages in `Write-PSmmHost` to prevent parameter binding errors when emitting blank lines during interactive setup. (2025-11-24)
- Fix: Harden `Write-PSmmHost` with comment-based help, `[OutputType]` and an analyzer suppression attribute for intentional `Write-Host` usage in interactive path. (2025-11-24)
- Perf/Quality: Reduced PSScriptAnalyzer issues from 216 → 72 by replacing `Write-Host` usages and improving wrapper behavior; results saved to `tests/PSScriptAnalyzerResults.json`. (2025-11-24)
- Tooling: Dot-source `tests/Preload-PSmmTypes.ps1` within `tests/Invoke-PSScriptAnalyzer.ps1` so CI runs preload PSmm classes/interfaces and no longer spam `TypeNotFound` parse noise.
- Tooling: Made `tests/Preload-PSmmTypes.ps1` path calculations platform-agnostic (no Windows-only separators) so CI on Linux can preload PSmm classes and avoid `TypeNotFound` spam.
- CI: Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run the repository's `tests/Invoke-PSScriptAnalyzer.ps1` wrapper (with preload and filtering) instead of a raw `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` call so GitHub Actions respects the same analyzer setup as local devs.
- Tests: Hardened `tests/Invoke-Pester.ps1` shutdown logic by forcing `Environment.Exit` on GitHub Actions while defaulting to `exit` locally; added `-PassThru` to keep the result object in scripts without auto-exiting. Prevents CI hangs without trapping interactive shells.

- Fix (2025-11-24): Export `Write-PSmmHost` from the `PSmm` module and ensure exit messaging is written before modules are unloaded.
  - Symptom: `The term 'Write-PSmmHost' is not recognized` during application shutdown in some sessions.
  - Impact: Fixes missing-symbol error and preserves final exit message output.
  - Files: `src/Modules/PSmm/PSmm.psm1`, `src/Modules/PSmm/PSmm.psd1`, `src/PSmediaManager.ps1`.

### Security

- Workflows: bumped `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` to `v4` inside the Codacy security scan so SARIF uploads stay compatible with GitHub Advanced Security requirements.

## [v1.0.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

- Initial public scaffold and core modules.

## How to use this changelog (recommended workflow)

- Keep entries under `Unreleased` as you work (use the category headings above).
- When ready to ship:

  1. Create a release branch or tag (e.g. `vX.Y.Z`).
  2. Move `Unreleased` entries into a new header `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and fill the date.
  3. Create a GitHub Release with the same notes (you can paste the section body into the release description).
  4. Tag the commit: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"` and `git push --tags`.

## PowerShell-specific recommendations

- If this repo publishes PowerShell modules (PSD1 manifests), update module `Version` in the appropriate `*.psd1` files to match the release tag.

  - Example: update `ModuleVersion` or `Version` fields inside `src/Modules/PSmm/PSmm.psd1`.

- Add a short compatibility note when changing minimum PowerShell requirement (e.g. `PowerShell 7.5.4+`).

- When changes affect public cmdlet names/signatures, list the impacted functions (module and function names).

## Automating releases (optional)

- Use GitHub Actions or Release Drafter to generate draft release notes automatically.

- Example: configure an Action to use `git log --format=%B` or `github-release-notes` to combine Conventional Commit messages into release notes.

## Tips

- Use Conventional Commits for clear automated release note generation (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`).
- Keep `Unreleased` concise. Move entries to a versioned section at release time.
- Link to issues/PRs for context when relevant (e.g., `(#123)`).
